# Frontend App Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a frontend application with React, Axios, Google Maps API, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

## Setting Up the Frontend App

1. Create a new React application using `create-react-app`:


2. Setup your environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
- Add your database and API key variables to the `.env` file. For example:
  ```
  REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
  REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```
- Remember to replace `your_database_url` and `your_api_key` with your actual database URL and API key.

3. Install required packages using npm:

4. Install and configure Tailwind CSS:
- Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root directory of your project.
- Run the following command to generate the default configuration file:
  ```
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```
- Update your `src/index.css` file to include Tailwind CSS styles:
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

5. Start the development server:
   
6. Your React app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Configuration

- For Axios, you can now make HTTP requests to your API using the environment variables you defined.
- For Google Maps API, you can use the `@react-google-maps/api` package to integrate Google Maps into your application. Refer to the package documentation for usage instructions.
- Tailwind CSS allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for usage instructions and styling options.
